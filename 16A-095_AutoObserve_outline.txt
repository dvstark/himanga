GBT 16A_095 Auto Observe script

I) Initialize: run setup scripts

II) Point/calibrate?

   -go to nearest calibration source or go to source closest to our
   targets?
   -use full list of calibrators, or select best ones (e.g., 3c48, 3c295...)

III) Choose plate to observe
     A) read in list with:
   	 1) plate ra/dec
	 2) plate status (e.g., "needs obs", "finished", "already
	 observed this session")

     B) choose best plate based among those needing observations

     	-final decision based on
	      (a) closest to zenith?
     	      (b) closest to starting position?
	      (c) have other optional priorities (e.g., if someone
      	      requests a certain target be observed, do that first)?

IV) slew to chosen plate
    A) read in list of targets for this plate with:
       1) ra/dec
       2) vhel
       3) observing time
       4) status (needs obs. or finished)
       5) priority (e.g., note sources we've started, so they are done
       first)

    B) filter out those that are finished (or are pending, e.g.,
    they've been observed but not yet reduced) and sort by priority
    
    C) observe targets one by one
       1) After each target is done, update the status in the target list

    D) finish observations after either
       (A) plate is finished
       (B) we get to low in the sky

    C) Update plate catalog to say that this plate was observed (so
    when we rerun step III, we don't choose it again)
    
       -note: maybe we should run this step immediately after slewing
        to this plate for the first time. If there is a crash and the
        operator must restart, then this plate may get observed twice
        accidentally.
    
(V) Repeat steps III-IV until time is up. Operator can just abort when
time is up.
